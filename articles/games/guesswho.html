(Hasbro’s) Guess Who? is a “search race” game between two players. 
Each player selects a character from a pool of 24 cards. 
The objective is to be the first to find the opponent's character 
by asking in turn YES/NO questions about the (physical) attributes of the character.

We would like to know which gameplay strategy is the best for this game? 
Let's consider with the most intuitive one: asking question that eliminates half of the candidates. 

Since we always eliminate half of the candidates then of course the expected 
number of eliminated possibilities is 1/2.

Is this the best we can do, what about other strategies, 
for example what if we ask a question that splits the candidate list into \( \frac{N}{3}\) and \( \frac{N}{3}\) 
where \(N\) is the number of total candidates.

The expected number of eliminated candidates is

$$ \frac{\frac{N}{3} \frac{2N}{3} + \frac{2N}{3} \frac{N}{3}}{N} $$ 

which can be simplified to \( \frac{4N}{9} \), and that number is less than \( \frac{N}{2} \).

The general formula for the expected number of eliminated candidates 
if we ask splitting the list into \( \frac{N}{x}\) and \( 1 - \frac{N}{x}\) is 
$$ \frac{ \frac{N}{x} \left( 1 - \frac{N}{x} \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{N}{x} \right) \frac{N}{x} } {N} $$
when we simplify the terms we end up with: \( 2N \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x^2} \right) \).

Then which number \(x\) number maximizes the expected value? 
When we take the derivative with respect to \(x\) we get
\( 2N \left( \frac{-1}{x^2} - \frac{-2}{x^3} \right) = 2N \left( \frac{2-x}{x^3} \right) \). 
Then we have \( x^{\star} = 2 \) which verifies that our intuition at the beggining was right.


<!--    
The rational gameplay strategy is to ask a "halving" question. 
But if the opponent is ahead of us then we should ask a "riskier" question 
with a better best-case value.

<!--<p>
In this game, each question can be seen as a set membership question: 
“Does the target belong to the set S?” 
We can construct the following binary matrix 
between characters and possible questions (sets).
</p>

<p>
The state of the game can be represented as a pair of two positive numbers, 
respectively the number of candidates for two players.

(n_0, m_0)
(n_1, m_0)
(n_1, m_1)
…
</p>
<p>
At each step the number of candidates decreases at least by one.
n_0 > n_1 > n_2 > n_3 > …
m_0 > m_1 > m_2 > m_3 > ...
A player wins the game when she remains with a single candidate, that must be the opponent's character. E.g. Player 1 wins if the game arrives at state (1, m_k>1).
At each step we ask a question which corresponds to a set S. We eliminate either |S| or n_i - |S| candidates.

        <section>
<p>
If we consider the “name” attribute of the characters, 
we can always find a question with |S|=n/2, |S|=n/3 
or in general |S|=n/p. e.g. 
Does your character’s name start with a letter that 
comes before the letter ‘F’?
What is the expected number of steps to find the target?
For |S| = n/2, in the worst-case (resp. best-case) scenario 
we can find the target in 5 (resp. 4) questions. 
Expected number is 4.6
</p>

<p>
For |S| = n/3, in the worst-case (resp. best-case) scenario 
we can find the target in 6 (resp. 3) questions. 
Expected number is 4.8
