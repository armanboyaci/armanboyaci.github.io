(Hasbro’s) Guess Who? is a “search race” game between two players. 
Each player selects a character from a pool of 24 cards. 
The objective is to be the first to find the opponent's character 
by asking in turn YES/NO questions about the (physical) attributes of the character.
</p>
<p>
In this game, each question can be seen as a set membership question: 
“Does the target belong to the set S?” 
We can construct the following binary matrix 
between characters and possible questions (sets).
</p>

<p>
The state of the game can be represented as a pair of two positive numbers, 
respectively the number of candidates for two players.

(n_0, m_0)
(n_1, m_0)
(n_1, m_1)
…
</p>
<p>
At each step the number of candidates decreases at least by one.
n_0 > n_1 > n_2 > n_3 > …
m_0 > m_1 > m_2 > m_3 > ...
A player wins the game when she remains with a single candidate, that must be the opponent's character. E.g. Player 1 wins if the game arrives at state (1, m_k>1).
At each step we ask a question which corresponds to a set S. We eliminate either |S| or n_i - |S| candidates.

If we consider the “name” attribute of the characters, 
we can always find a question with |S|=n/2, |S|=n/3 
or in general |S|=n/p. e.g. 
Does your character’s name start with a letter that 
comes before the letter ‘F’?
What is the expected number of steps to find the target?
For |S| = n/2, in the worst-case (resp. best-case) scenario 
we can find the target in 5 (resp. 4) questions. 
Expected number is 4.6
</p>

<p>
For |S| = n/3, in the worst-case (resp. best-case) scenario 
we can find the target in 6 (resp. 3) questions. 
Expected number is 4.8
</p>

<p>
The rational gameplay strategy is to ask 
a "halving" question. 
But if the opponent is ahead of us then 
we should ask a "riskier" question 
with a better best-case value.
