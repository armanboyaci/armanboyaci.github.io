    <p> In Blackjack, the game have some differences for a player and for the dealer. 
        <ol>
            <li>
                The player plays first and if she is busted, she loses her bet. 
                Suppose in the same round the dealer is also busted, but the player is not getting her money back. 
                That means if both the player and the dealer are busted, 
                the player loses money, which can be considered unfair for the player.
            </li>
            <li>
                The house pays 3/2 of the bet when the player has a natural (an ace and a ten). 
                This is a promotion to the player because the player does not lose 3/2 of her bet when the dealer gets a natural.
            </li>
            <li>
                The dealer follows a fixed strategy, hit until 17 and face one of the starting cards in her hand. 
                The player could make the optimal decisions for stopping, doubling and splitting according to this open card.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The house has an edge of $0.68 per $100 bet.

    The expected outcome of a Blackjack play can be calculated as follows 
    <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="marginnote">
        Here we assume that the two probabilities are independent from each other, which is not exactly true but not a bad approximation.
    </span>
    
    $$ E_{i,k} = X_{j,l} P_{i,j} P'_{k,l} $$
    <ul>
        <li> \(X_{j,l} \) is the outcome matrix given that finally your hand is \( j \) and dealer's hand is \(l \). </li>
        <li> \(P_{i,j}  \) is the probability that your hand will be \(j\) given that your current hand is \(i\). </li>
        <li> \(P'_{k,l}  \) is the probability that dealer's hand will be \(l\) given that your dealer's open card is \(k\). </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Here is the outcome matrix \(X_{j,l} \) for <i>unit</i> bets.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="blackjack_outcome.svg" />
</figure>

<p>Note that the outcome matrix is mostly symmetrical. There are two (important) exceptions: 
    <ol>
        <li>If a player's hand is 21 in the first two cards it is called <i>natural</i> or <i>blackjack</i> and she immediately wins (unless dealer reveals also a natural). And the house pays 3/2 of her bets.
        <li>If a player is busted she immediately loses her bet (even if dealer is also busted).</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    The first (resp. second) exception is in the favor of the player (resp. the house). 
    But their probabilities are significantly different. 
    Player gets a natural with probability \(1/20\). 
    On the other hand both player and dealer are busted in the same play with probability is \( ? \)
</p>

In the blackjack game, the dealer follows a fixed 
and known strategy: “Hit until 17”. 
At the end, she can have 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 
or she is busted (she has 22 or more) 
with the following probabilities given her first card.
</p>

<p>
    These probabilities can be computed 
    by multiplying the following transition matrix 
    by itself several times. 
    But how many times? 
    With each multiplication we increase the 
    number of cards in the dealer's hand. 
    5 times should be enough to land one of the 
    absorbing states.
</p>

<p>
    Here, we assume that we sample cards with replacement. 
    This is not the reality 
    because cards in a play leave the game 
    until there are not enough cards, 
    then we reshuffle everything. 
    But not a bad assumption 
    if there are a large number of decks 
    (8 in most casinos). 
    More work is needed to compute exact probabilities.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
    You may think that the casino (aka the house) 
    makes all the necessary calculations 
    and selects the best strategy. 
    Therefore you should mimic the dealer. 
    But this is a bad idea. 
    On average, you lose $5.6 for each $100 bet. 
    You can verify this by running the following code.
</p>

<p>
    But why? If the reward mechanism were symmetrical 
    for both the player and the dealer 
    then their expected rewards should be the same, zero. 
    But this is not the case in casinos.
</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>
        Let’s analyse the impact of two changes breaking 
        the symmetry in the casino’s reward mechanism.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        1) The player plays first and if she is busted, 
        she loses her bet. 
        Suppose in the same round the dealer is also busted, 
        but the player is not getting her money back. 
        That means if both the player 
        and the dealer are busted, 
        the player loses money, 
        which can be considered unfair.
    </p>
    
<p>
(Assuming the player uses the dealer’s strategy) 
The probability of both the player and the dealer 
being busted is ~7.9%. On average, 
the player loses ~$7.9 per $100 bet.
</p>

</section>


<section>
<p>
2) The house pays 3/2 of the bet 
when the player has a natural (an ace and a ten). 
This is a promotion to the player 
because the player does not lose 3/2 of her bet 
when the dealer gets a natural. 
</p>
<p>
The probability for a player to get a natural 
(and not the dealer) is ~4.6%. 
On average, the player gains an extra 
(compared to the symmetrical reward system) ~$2.3 per $100 bet.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>
Of course we can do better than mimicking the dealer. 
We can calculate the optimal stopping point, 
depending on the dealer's visible card. 
Plus, we can optimally decide on doubling and splitting. 
However, all of these are not enough to make money in the long run.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, how do we calculate optimal stopping points? 
For each state (our hand + dealer’s card), 
we calculate the expected value of standing. 
Then we compare it with the expected value of hitting.    
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that if the total hand is < 12 hitting 
will improve the expected value, since there is no risk of busting. 
However, at some point standing makes more sense. 
This point depends on the dealer's card.
</p>

<p>
How do we calculate these expected values? 
Below you see the expected values of standing.
</p>

<p>
And the expected values of hitting.    
</p>

The formulas to calculate the expected values.
