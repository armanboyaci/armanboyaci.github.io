<p>A tic-tac-toe game has 9 cells. 
   “X” plays one of them as a first move 
   and “O” plays one among the remaining 8 cells. 
   In total there are 72 possible first-moves. 
   But most of them are equivalent under rotations 
   and reflections. 
   There are 12 “different” first-moves.
</p>

<!--<p>W.l.o.g. X can play the corner (11), 
    the edge (12) or the center (22). 
    Playing corners {11, 13, 31, 33} are equivalent 
    using rotations, similarly edges {12, 21, 23, 32}.
</p>

<p>
    Assume X plays the center. 
    Then O can play an edge {(22, 12), (22, 21), (22, 32), (22, 23)} 
    or a corner {(22, 11), (22, 31), (22, 33), (22, 13)}, 
    but those are equivalence groups using rotations. 
    Therefore w.l.o.g. we can assume the possible first-moves are (22, 12) and (22, 11).
</p>

<p>
    If X plays the corner, O can play 5 different moves: 
    an incident edge {(11, 12), (11, 21)} 
    an opposite edge {(11, 32), (11, 23)}, 
    an incident corner {(11, 31), (11, 13)}, 
    the center (11, 22) or the opposite corner (11, 33). 
</p>

<p>
    By reflection on the diagonal containing 11, these are equivalence groups.
    Similarly if X plays the edge, there are again 5 different moves.
    In total, there are 12 different first-moves.

    <!--In the tic-tac-toe game, there are 12 first-move patterns. -->
    In 7 of them, (X) always wins by applying the following sequence of moves. 
</p>

<p>
    The second player (O) cannot prevent the defeat 
    because her second-move is enforced 
    (she should “block”) and her third-move is irrelevant 
    because (X) has a “fork”.
</p>

<p>
    In the rest of 5 first-move patterns, 
    (X) can always lead the game to a tie. 
    How? (X) enforces a position for which 
    (O) cannot have a fork.

<!--<section>
<p>
        Finally, we need to convince ourselves that X cannot win in these 5 first-move patterns. We verify that X cannot have a fork.

There are three types of forks: 
<ul>
    <li>Type (I): 1 corner + 1 edge + 1 center</li>
    <li>Type (II): 2 corners + center, </li>
    <li>Type (III): 3 corners</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Consider two patterns in which O plays center. 
    None of Type (I), (II) and Type (III) are possible 
    since the center is occupied.
</p>
<p>
    When X plays center, O plays corner, 
    Type (III) is not possible by definition. 
    Type (II) is not possible since a corner is occupied. ,
    X cannot have a fork of Type (I) 
    because in all cases the third move of X is enforced 
    and that position is not a fork.
</p>

<p>
    When X plays edge and O plays incident corner, 
    the only possible fork type is (I) since 
    it contains an edge. But we can see that it is 
    not the case by using the previous argument.
</p>

<p>
    When X plays edge and O plays opposite Edge, 
    Type (I) is again not possible because the 
    opposite edge should be clear.
</p>
