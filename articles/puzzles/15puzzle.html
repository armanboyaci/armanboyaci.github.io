                In this puzzle we have a 4x4 grid and tiles labeled 1 to 15. We use the remaining empty position to move the tiles. 
                The aim is to arrange them in a numerical order (which is not always possible).

                Let's talk about a possible solution strategy. We can easily place 1,2,5 and 6 in their correct position.

                We need to be a little bit careful about the rest of the tiles. 
                For example we can not simply put tile 3 in its correct place first and tile 4 later. 
                We are going to put tiles 3 & 4 in one of the following positions then we can place them in their positions. 
                <img src="15puzzle-34.png">
                Suppose that tiles 3 & 4 are not in this position, then we can assume that they are in one of the following positions.
                Consider 2x3 sub-grid containing these tiles, note that there are two 2x2 sub-grids: top and bottom. 
                <img src="15puzzle-34-rotate.png">
                First consider the bottom 2x2 sub-grid and rotate clockwise direction (anti-clockwise direction in the second case). 
                We repeat the same rotation operation in the top 2x2 sub-grid. We can push tiles 3 & 4 up, this way we end up the desired positions.
