              In this puzzle we have three rods and n disks of different sizes. 
              At the beginning all disks are at the same rod in a decreasing order and the objective is to move all of them to another rod.
              The only constraint is we can not place a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.

              The typical solution strategy for this puzzle is to use recursion. If we want to move the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> disk to the target rod, 
              we first need to move disks 1 through <em>n</em>-1 to the auxiliary rod. Once that is achieved, we can move the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> disk 
              to the target rod. As a final step, we move disks 1 through <em>n</em>-1 from the auxiliary rod to the target rod.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this point, we can disregard the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> disk, as it is already in place. With the remaining <em>n</em>-1 disks, we 
              repeat the same strategy. However, we must be careful, as the starting rod for the <em>n</em>-1 disks has now changed, and the roles of 
              the starting rod and the auxiliary rod are swapped. 
            </p>

          <p>
              For the base case, when there is only one disk, we can simply move it to the target rod, as it is the smallest disk in the entire stack.
          </p>

              <code class="language-python">
               def tower(n, source, target, auxalary):
                  if n == 1:
                     # "Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}"
                     move_list.append([1, source, target])
                  else:
                     tower(n-1, source, auxalary, target)
                     # "Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}"
                     move_list.append([n, source, target])
                     tower(n-1, auxalary, target, source)
