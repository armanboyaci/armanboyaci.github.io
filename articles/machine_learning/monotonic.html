In some machine learning applications, it makes sense for certain inputs to have a monotonic effect on the output. 
For example, we expect sales to decrease as price increases. 
Linear regression can often capture this kind of relationship on its own, using ordinal variables. 
But for models like decision trees or gradient boosting, we need to add monotonicity constraints 
to make sure the model follows this expected pattern.
</p>

<section>
<p>
In some cases, we know from experience that a certain input should always affect the result in one direction. 
For example, we expect sales to go down when prices go up. 
Flexible models might not always learn this from the data, especially if the data is noisy or limited. 
Without rules, the model could show results that don’t make sense. 
By adding monotonicity constraints, we guide the model to follow these rules. 
This makes the model easier to understand and helps domain experts trust its predictions.
</p>

<p>
A linear model follows monotonic relationships by default, but it can be too limited when the real-world relationship is non-linear.
To address this, we can apply transformations like log, exponential, or polynomial functions. 
These can help capture more complex patterns while still keeping the relationship monotonic.
</p>

<p>
There are also other ways to model monotonic relationships. 
Isotonic regression is a non-parametric method that fits a free-form monotonic function to the data. 
Bayesian models can also be adapted using modeling tricks to encourage monotonicity, 
such as applying constraints on the function shape or parameter ordering. 
And many tree-based models, like XGBoost or LightGBM, allow monotonicity constraints to be set directly during training. 
These options give us flexibility to choose the right balance between model complexity, interpretability, and domain alignment.

Isotonic regression is a simple yet powerful method for modeling monotonic relationships. 
It fits a non-decreasing (or non-increasing) function to the data without assuming a specific functional form. 
This makes it flexible and easy to interpret. However, in practice—such as in the scikit-learn implementation, 
it only supports one-dimensional inputs, which limits its use in more complex or high-dimensional problems.
</p>

<p>
In Bayesian models, monotonicity can be encouraged through clever parameterization. 
One common approach is to define the model coefficients as a cumulative sum of strictly non-negative increments. 
For example, starting from a base coefficient, each additional coefficient is defined by adding a positive offset 
drawn from a Half-Normal distribution. 
This guarantees that each coefficient is greater than or equal to the previous one, enforcing a non-decreasing relationship. 
This modeling trick allows us to build flexible, probabilistic models that respect monotonicity without needing to hard-code 
the shape of the function.
</p>

<p>
Tree-based models like XGBoost and LightGBM offer built-in support for monotonicity constraints. 
By specifying which features should have a positive or negative effect on the output, 
the algorithm builds trees that follow these rules during training.
