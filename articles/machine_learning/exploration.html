In some machine learning settings, the data we observe depends on the actions we take, 
creating a distinct challenge compared to typical supervised learning, where data is independent of the model’s behavior. 
In these environments, the model must explore different actions while balancing 
the trade-off between exploiting known good actions and discovering better ones. 
Without sufficient exploration, the model may fail to maximize long-term total rewards which is typically the objective. 
In this post, we compare some common exploration methods.

Let’s consider two scenarios: a supply chain manager and a merchant. 
The supply chain manager aims to maintain a balanced inventory to avoid out-of-stock situations, 
while the merchant makes discount decisions to increase profit. 
Both rely on demand estimations, but the key difference is that the merchant influences demand 
through their discount decisions, i.e. different discount levels lead to different demand patterns. 
In contrast, the supply chain manager’s replenishment decisions do not directly impact demand; 
we can assume that the demand remains unchanged regardless of inventory decisions.
