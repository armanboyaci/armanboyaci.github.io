When we apply a logarithmic transformation to the target variable and train a model, 
the feature coefficients are generally estimated accurately, except for the intercept. 
However, when we transform the predictions back to the original scale by exponentiating them, 
the model often systematically underestimates the mean response. Another challenge is that the log of zero is undefined, 
so we typically add a small constant to the target before applying the log. 
This shift can also affect the model’s coefficients and predictions.    
</p>

<h2>Why do we apply log transformation?</h2>
<p>
One of the main reasons we apply a logarithmic transformation to the target variable is 
to address issues with the structure of residuals in the original space. 
In many real-world datasets, especially those involving multiplicative relationships, 
the residuals tend to increase as the predicted values increase. 
This violates a key assumption of linear regression that residuals should have constant variance (homoscedasticity) 
and be independent of the predicted values. 
By applying a log transformation, we stabilize the variance and make the residuals more homoscedastic and symmetric, 
allowing the linear model to better satisfy its assumptions and produce more reliable estimates.

<p>
However when we take the logarithm of the target variable and train a regression model, 
the feature coefficients are usually accurate, but the intercept is not. 
This happens because the model learns in log-space, where the relationship is linear. 
However, when we convert the predictions back to the original scale by taking the exponential, 
we often underestimate the average value. This is because the average of the log values, 
when exponentiated, doesn’t equal the average of the original values. 
The reason lies in the exponential function being non-linear, a concept explained by Jensen's inequality. 
The more variation there is in the log-scale errors, the larger the underestimation.
</p>

<p>
To build some intuition around this effect, consider a simple numerical experiment. 
Suppose we generate a set of positive random numbers. We can compute the mean in two different ways: 
(1) directly in the original space, and (2) by first taking the logarithm of the numbers, 
calculating the mean in log-space, and then exponentiating that mean. 
We’ll find that the second method consistently yields a lower value than the first. 
This illustrates how transforming to and from log-space affects our estimates, 
particularly when the data exhibit high variance.

<h2>Fix</h2>
    <p>
The expected value of log-normal distribution is not μ but μ + σ2/2 
that is why we were underestimating the mean in the above example when we use exp(mean (log x)). 
So we can fix this, we just need to add the half of the variance of the numbers in the log space.
</p>

<p>
The caveat is that this “correction“ only works if the residuals of the model have a log-normal distribution.
</p>

<p>
In the following example we consider a zero-inflated log-normal distribution. 
And we see that this correction does not work as expected.
</p>

<p>
In this example we chose the shift parameter (arbitrarily) as 1. 
We may think that choosing a smaller value for the shift parameter could fix the issue:
</p>

<p>
But it looks like that (at least for this example), the results are getting worse when we choose smaller shift parameter values. 
Interestingly for big values we have better results. 
More importantly it converges to the actual mean. 
We can also observe that not only ‘corrected’ mean (black lines in the plots) are converging to the actual mean 
but also the exp of arithmetic mean of log numbers (green lines in the plots)!
</p>

<p>
Why is this happening? The zero-inflated distribution can be seen as a mixture of two distributions (bunch of zeros + normal distribution). 
When we increase the shift parameter these two distributions approach to each other and eventually they merge:
</p>

<p>
The catch is we don’t learn the “correct“ coefficients (in the log space).
